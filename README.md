# Message-Me

This is a Rails chat application that uses Redis to employ ActionCable in production. A user can sign on with a unique username and password and send messages in real time to others that are signed on to the app. Using the username, 'guest', and the password, 'password', you will be able to navigate the application and its features. Open two separate browsers in order for best use!
